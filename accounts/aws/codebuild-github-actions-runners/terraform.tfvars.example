# from the username/org. For example:
# github_repository_url = "https://github.com/your-github-username-or-org/your-repo"
# If not set, the module may derive it from other inputs depending on your setup.

# CodeConnections connection ARN for GitHub (using GitHub App)
# When provided, CodeConnections will be used instead of webhooks and PAT authentication.
# Example format (replace with your actual ARN):

# CodeBuild Runners Configuration
# Supports:
# - ON_DEMAND: Standard CodeBuild compute types
# - FLEET: Compute Fleets with reserved capacity
#
# This example shows two ON_DEMAND runners (x86_64 and arm64) with:
# - 2 vCPUs
# - 4 GB memory
# - 64 GB disk
# - VPC configuration included
#
# NOTES:
# - Replace vpc_id and subnet_ids with your own network values.
# - For FLEET runners, set compute_type = "FLEET" and adjust fields as needed.
# - Ensure images and compute types are valid in your chosen region.
