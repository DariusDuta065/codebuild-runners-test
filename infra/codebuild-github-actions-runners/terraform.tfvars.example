# CodeBuild Compute Fleet Configuration (optional)
# Defaults to two fleets: Linux x86_64 and Linux ARM64 (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM, 64 GB disk each)
# Constraints: vCPU (2-4), Memory (2-8 GB), Disk (64 GB fixed)
# Overflow builds always run on-demand
# See COMPUTE_FLEETS.md for guidance on when to use fleets.
#
# Default configuration:
# compute_fleets = [
#   {
#     architecture     = "x86_64"
#     minimum_capacity = 1
#   },
#   {
#     architecture     = "arm64"
#     minimum_capacity = 1
#   }
# ]
#
# Example: Custom fleet configuration with VPC
# compute_fleets = [
#   {
#     name             = "custom-x86-fleet"
#     architecture     = "x86_64"

#     architecture     = "arm64"
#     minimum_capacity = 1
#   }

# Example: Disable fleets (empty list)
# compute_fleets = []
